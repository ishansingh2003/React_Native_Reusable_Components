# React_Native_Reusable_Components
A library of react native reusable and customisable components

Lets create a repo of easily customisable and plug n play components in react native, to help the community

The Following are the current components added:<br/>
<table>
  <th>Component Name</th>
  <th>Component Description</th>
  <tr>
    <td><ol><li>Customised Flat List</li></ol></td>
    <td>This is a wrapper written around react-native Flat List & Section List which supports callback, left image, right arrow in the list item. All of this can be achieved with a single codebase</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

Will keep updating this. Please feel free to download the cookbook react-native app to see how the list is working. Or dive into the code straight away
